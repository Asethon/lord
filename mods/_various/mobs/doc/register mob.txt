    Mobs
    ====

    This mod adds mobs to Minetest.

    Minetest's damage system
    ------------------------
    The damage system in Minetest is more complex than just hold down the left mouse button. After the first punch your hand or weapon has a "reload" time. This is for most weapons 1 second. After the reload time the player can punch again.

    Settings
    --------
    When you add `only_peaceful_mobs = true` to minetest.conf then all hostile mobs will despawn.
    `display_mob_spawn = true` will show you a message in the chat when a mob spawns.

    Items
    -----
    * Meat: dropped by sheep upon dying. When cooked in a furnace, results in cooked meat that heals players when eaten.
    * Wheat: players holding wheat cause sheep to follow them. Right clicking sheep with wheat tames them.

    List of mobs
    ------------

    ### Hostile mobs
    Hostile mobs walk arround in the world and start to attack the player when they see him.

    * Dirt Monster: spawns on grass at night. It has the same velocity as the player and cause 1 heart damage. It dies in water, lava and sunlight. Drops dirt when killed by a player.
    * Stone Monster: spawns on normal stone in the dark. It is slower than the player but can only be hurt by at least a stone sword. It causes 2 heart damage and is immune to water, lava and light. Drops mossy cobble when killed by a player.
    * Sand Monster: spawns at deserts. It is faster than the player but dies fast and doesnt cause much damage. It dies in water and lava. Drops sand when killed by a player.
    * Oerkki: from version 0.3 of Minetest. It spawns on stone in the dark and has same velocity as the player. It causes more damage than the dirt monster and dies in lava and water.
    * Dungeon Master: from version 0.3 of Minetest. It spawns on stone in the dark and throws fireballs at the player. It dies in water and lava and the player needs at least a stone sword to kill it. Has a 1% chance of dropping MESE when killed by a player.

    ### Friendly mobs
    Friendly mobs walk arround in the world. They do not attack the player but some of them have useful features.

    * Sheep: friendly animal that walks randomly in the world. It spawns on grass and gives the player wool if right clicked and meat if he kills it. It will follow players holding wheat. If fed wheat by right clicking, they are tamed, do not despawn, and regrow wool.
    * Rat: from version 0.3 of Minetest. Its a friendly animal that spawns on grass and stone. The player can right click it to get it into his inventory. In the inventory the rat can be replaced in the world or cooked in the furnace.

    API
    ---
    You can use the API of simple mobs in your own mods if you have it installed. See the [init.lua]([url]https://github.com/PilzAdam/mobs/blob/master/init.lua[/url]) file in the mod to have some examples of the usage.

    Simple Mobs has a simple API. Other mods can use the functions to add their own mobs.

    For each mob that spawns with this function is a field in `mobs.spawning_mobs`. It tells if the mob should spawn or not. Default is `true`. So other mods can only use the API of this mod by disabling the spawning of the default mobs in this mod.
